# juniorHighPoorGame

It‘s a pascal game that was made when we’re in junior high school. We are training for NOIP at that time.

## Environment

- Free Pascal 2.0.4
- Windows XP sp3

## note

- There may be some problems when the program is running in OS higher than Windows 8
- tfbak.exe is previously built in the environment mentioned above, so it can be directly double clicked and run
